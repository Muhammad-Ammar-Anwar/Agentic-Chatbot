# Weekly AI News Summary

<think>
Okay, so I need to help the user by summarizing AI news articles into markdown format. Let me look at the instructions again to make sure I understand what's needed. 

The user wants each item to include the date in YYYY-MM-DD format in PST timezone, a concise summary, sorted with the latest first, and the source URL as a link. The format should be "### [Date] - [Summary](URL)".

First, I'll need to process each article provided. There are several, so I'll go through them one by one. 

Looking at the first article, the content is about Google partnering with a Bitcoin mining company for AI. The date provided is Fri, 26 Sep 2025 07:07:47 GMT. Since the user wants PST, I need to convert that. GMT is UTC+0, and PST is UTC-8, so subtracting 8 hours from September 26 would make it September 25. Wait, but the date in the content is Sep 26, so maybe I need to adjust that. Let me check: if it's 7 AM GMT on the 26th, PST would be 11 PM on the 25th. So the date should be 2025-09-25.

Next, the summary needs to be concise. The article talks about Google acquiring a 5.4% stake in Cipher Mining, which is a Bitcoin mining company, and how this partnership is for AI technology. It mentions increased computing capacity and Texas as a growth center. So the summary should capture that.

Moving to the second article about Alibaba's stock surge due to AI ambitions. The date is Thu, 25 Sep 2025 10:47:35 GMT. Converting to PST, that would be the same date, 2025-09-25. The summary should include Alibaba's investment in AI, partnership with Nvidia, and their plans for cloud services.

The third article is about GE Aerospace and Merlin Labs collaborating on AI-powered autonomy for aircraft. The date is Fri, 26 Sep 2025 12:47:15 GMT, which converts to 2025-09-25 in PST. The summary should mention the collaboration, the integration of flight systems with autonomy software, and the testing on KC-135 aircraft.

The fourth article discusses the UK's mission to safely embed AI, as stated by David Lammy at the UN. The date is Thu, 25 Sep 2025 12:33:31 GMT, so PST date is 2025-09-25. The summary needs to highlight the UK's mission, the risks and benefits of AI, and the call for international cooperation.

The fifth article is about Tipalti raising $200 million for AI and global growth. The date is Wed, 24 Sep 2025 13:27:56 GMT, which becomes 2025-09-24 in PST. The summary should include the funding, investment in AI, and the automation features Tipalti offers.

The sixth article covers state ed-tech leaders prioritizing AI. The date is Fri, 26 Sep 2025 15:59:08 GMT, converting to 2025-09-25. The summary should mention the shift in priorities, the reasons behind it, and the report's findings.

The seventh article is about AI in agriculture, specifically using AI to identify seed varieties. The date is Tue, 30 Sep 2025 16:53:15 GMT, which converts to 2025-09-29 in PST. The summary should talk about Syngenta and Heritable using AI for crop selection.

The eighth article is about HeartFlow's FDA clearance for their coronary plaque analysis AI. The date is Wed, 24 Sep 2025 16:00:00 GMT, so PST is 2025-09-24. The summary needs to include the FDA clearance, the improvement in plaque detection, and the significance for clinicians and patients.

The ninth article explores whether human and AI intelligence are the same, from Harvard's BKC. The date is Sun, 28 Sep 2025 07:15:00 GMT, which is 2025-09-27 in PST. The summary should discuss the exploration and the implications for understanding human mind and AI development.

The tenth article is about California's AI safety law signed by Gavin Newsom. The date is Mon, 29 Sep 2025 20:53:13 GMT, converting to 2025-09-29 in PST. The summary should mention the law, its strength compared to others, and its implications for the tech industry.

The eleventh article discusses AI and digitalization in the maritime workforce. The date is Wed, 01 Oct 2025 08:34:18 GMT, which is 2025-09-30 in PST. The summary should cover the impact of AI on maritime operations and the need for workforce adaptation.

The twelfth article is about Mekorot's leadership in water tech using AI. The date is Tue, 30 Sep 2025 17:35:00 GMT, converting to 2025-09-29 in PST. The summary should include their global projects and the role of AI in their innovations.

The thirteenth article is about the University of Kansas hosting an AI week with Google. The date is Fri, 26 Sep 2025 23:35:52 GMT, which becomes 2025-09-25 in PST. The summary should mention the event, partnership with Google, and KU's intentional approach to AI adoption.

The fourteenth article is about Anthropic releasing Claude Sonnet 4.5 for autonomous tasks. The date is Mon, 29 Sep 2025 21:56:15 GMT, converting to 2025-09-29 in PST. The summary should highlight the model's capabilities in building software and business tasks.

The fifteenth article covers various top tech news including HSBC, IBM, and Microsoft. The date is Sun, 28 Sep 2025 09:25:35 GMT, which is 2025-09-27 in PST. The summary should mention the bond-trading algorithm improvement and Microsoft's strategy on Azure.

Now, I need to sort all these articles by date, latest first. So I'll list them from 2025-09-30 down to 2025-09-24.

I also need to ensure each summary is concise and captures the main points without being too lengthy. Each should be a single sentence, but if needed, two sentences are acceptable as long as they're succinct.

I should also check that all URLs are correctly formatted as links in markdown. Each summary will be in the format "- [Summary](URL)" under the appropriate date header.

I need to make sure that the dates are correctly converted to PST. Let me double-check a few to ensure accuracy. For example, the article with date Wed, 01 Oct 2025 in GMT is actually September 30 in PST because October 1st 8 AM GMT is September 30 0:00 PST plus 8 hours, making it still September 30.

Finally, I'll compile all the processed articles into the required markdown format, ensuring that the latest date comes first and each entry follows the specified structure.
